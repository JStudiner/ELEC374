DUT is design under test

make testbench for smaller modules but not all (waste of time)

Large testbench connects all modules 

set initial values of rising edge: always (rising_edge)

Add clock input to all modules that take more than 1 cycle 

for booth 
- convert function to module with its own input and outputs 
- connect thoses input outputs to the ALU in datapath
- have clk input in ALU which controls/allows the booth module to be run once per cycle
- implememnt a reset signal for the booth module to signal to the ALU the Booth calculation is do`default_nettype 
- revamp the booth to split up each iteration of forloop to 1 clk cycle
- make the input for the ALU 32 bits (A,B) 
- output 64 bits
